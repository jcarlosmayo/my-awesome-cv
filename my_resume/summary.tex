Platform and Data Engineer specialized in designing and deploying cloud-based data platforms built on modular, infrastructure-as-code architectures, making them easy to scale and govern. Proven track record in delivering end-to-end data pipelines, containerized services, and real-time analytics ecosystems for multinational organizations. Technical expertise spans Terraform-driven infrastructure, Docker deployments, Kafka streaming, Snowpark development, and advanced analytics tooling. My career has evolved across the full data spectrum — from visualizations and BI reporting to analytics, ETL, and ultimately platform engineering and architecture — giving me a holistic perspective reinforced by my background in business management.
